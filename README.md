# specification_search
Supplementary material from the paper "Spatial Econometric Model SpeciÔ¨Åcation Search", by Anselin, Serenini &amp; Amaral

The folder [data_master](https://github.com/pedrovma/specification_search/tree/main/data_master) contains the shapefiles used in the simulations. [Codes](https://github.com/pedrovma/specification_search/tree/main/Codes) includes the five Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a different specification strategy. These notebooks are templates that allow for modifications in the spatial layout, error process, error distribution, or p-value. The complete set of resuls used in the paper are displayed across spreadsheet files in [Results](https://github.com/pedrovma/specification_search/tree/main/Results) folder. The file [000_Sumary](https://github.com/pedrovma/specification_search/blob/main/Results/000_Summary.xlsx) describes all the files in this folder. The folder [Results_by_strategy](https://github.com/pedrovma/specification_search/tree/main/Results/Results_by_strategy) contains spreedsheats with results consolidated by strategy and spatial layout.
